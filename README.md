Learning Backbone and Marionette with Pluralsight [course](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/marionette-fundamentals/table-of-contents)

Backbone is event driven system, better to emit events and have other things such as views to subscribe/react to those events.

Marionette standard to name events separated by colon.

`Marionette.ItemView.extend` must specify a `template`

`Marionette.CollectionView.extend` must specify a `childView`
